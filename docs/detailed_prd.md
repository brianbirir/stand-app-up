## Detailed Requirements Breakdown

| Requirement ID | Description | User Story | Expected Behavior/Outcome |
|----------------|-------------|------------|---------------------------|
| **AUTH-001** | User Authentication & Authorization | As a scrum master, I want to securely log into the application so that I can manage my team's stand-up process | The system provides secure login functionality with role-based access control, allowing scrum masters to access admin features while team members have appropriate permissions |
| **AUTH-002** | Team Management | As a scrum master, I want to create and manage team members so that I can control who receives stand-up reminders | The system allows adding, editing, and removing team members with their Slack user information and role assignments |
| **CONFIG-001** | Reminder Time Configuration | As a scrum master, I want to set the daily reminder time so that my team receives stand-up prompts at the optimal time | The system allows configuration of reminder times (e.g., 9:00 AM) with timezone support and saves these settings persistently |
| **CONFIG-002** | Custom Question Configuration | As a scrum master, I want to customize stand-up questions so that they align with my team's specific needs | The system provides an interface to create, edit, reorder, and delete custom questions with default templates available |
| **CONFIG-003** | End-of-Day Time Configuration | As a scrum master, I want to set the end-of-day deadline so that the system knows when to stop sending reminders | The system allows configuration of deadline times (e.g., 4:00 PM) after which no more reminders are sent |
| **SLACK-001** | Slack Bot Integration | As a team member, I want to receive stand-up reminders through Slack so that I can participate without leaving my workflow | The system integrates with Slack to send automated messages to designated channels or direct messages |
| **SLACK-002** | Interactive Question Flow | As a team member, I want to answer stand-up questions step-by-step through Slack so that the process feels natural and guided | The bot sends questions sequentially, waits for responses, and guides users through the complete stand-up process |
| **SLACK-003** | Slack Response Processing | As a system, I need to capture and process Slack responses so that stand-up data is automatically recorded | The system receives Slack webhook events, parses responses, and stores them in the database with proper attribution |
| **REMIND-001** | Daily Reminder Scheduling | As a scrum master, I want reminders to be sent automatically at configured times so that I don't have to manually prompt my team | The system uses Celery to schedule and send daily reminders at specified times to all active team members |
| **REMIND-002** | Follow-up Reminder System | As a scrum master, I want team members who haven't responded to receive hourly follow-up reminders so that participation rates remain high | The system tracks response status and sends hourly reminders to non-responders until the deadline or until they complete their stand-up |
| **REMIND-003** | Reminder Cessation | As a team member, I want reminders to stop at a reasonable time so that I'm not bothered outside of work hours | The system stops sending reminders after the configured end-of-day time (e.g., 4:00 PM) |
| **DATA-001** | Stand-up Response Storage | As a system, I need to store all stand-up responses so that historical data is preserved and can be analyzed | The system stores responses with timestamps, user attribution, question-answer pairs, and metadata in PostgreSQL database |
| **DATA-002** | Response Tracking | As a scrum master, I want to track who has and hasn't submitted stand-ups so that I can monitor team participation | The system maintains real-time status of submission completion for each team member each day |
| **REPORT-001** | Daily Summary Generation | As a scrum master, I want to receive end-of-day summaries so that I can assess team participation and identify issues | The system automatically generates and sends daily summary reports showing participation statistics and individual status |
| **REPORT-002** | Participation Analytics | As a scrum master, I want to see participation percentages so that I can measure team engagement | The system calculates and displays the percentage of team members who completed stand-ups vs. those who didn't |
| **REPORT-003** | Non-participant Identification | As a scrum master, I want to know specifically who didn't submit stand-ups so that I can follow up individually | The system provides a clear list of team members who didn't complete their stand-ups by the deadline |
| **UI-001** | Web Dashboard | As a scrum master, I want a web interface to manage all settings so that I can easily configure and monitor the system | The React frontend provides an intuitive dashboard for configuration, team management, and viewing reports |
| **UI-002** | Stand-up History View | As a scrum master, I want to view historical stand-up data so that I can track trends and team progress | The system provides searchable, filterable views of historical stand-up submissions with export capabilities |
| **UI-003** | Real-time Status Dashboard | As a scrum master, I want to see real-time submission status so that I can monitor daily progress | The dashboard shows live updates of who has completed stand-ups and who is still pending |
| **NOTIF-001** | Slack Summary Delivery | As a scrum master, I want end-of-day summaries delivered to Slack so that the information is easily accessible | The system sends formatted summary reports to designated Slack channels at the configured end-of-day time |
| **NOTIF-002** | Configurable Notification Channels | As a scrum master, I want to choose where notifications are sent so that information reaches the right audience | The system allows configuration of different Slack channels for reminders, responses, and summaries |
| **PERF-001** | Scalable Architecture | As a system administrator, I want the application to handle multiple teams so that it can scale across the organization | The system architecture supports multiple teams, scrum masters, and concurrent operations without performance degradation |
| **PERF-002** | Reliable Message Delivery | As a team member, I want to reliably receive reminders so that I don't miss stand-up opportunities | The system implements retry mechanisms and error handling to ensure message delivery reliability |
| **SEC-001** | Data Security | As a scrum master, I want team data to be secure so that sensitive information is protected | The system implements appropriate security measures including data encryption, secure API endpoints, and access controls |
| **SEC-002** | Slack Token Management | As a system administrator, I want Slack integrations to be secure so that unauthorized access is prevented | The system securely manages Slack bot tokens and API credentials with proper rotation and storage practices |
